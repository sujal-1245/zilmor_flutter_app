### 📽️ To Add Your Screen Recording:

Here’s how to include a screen recording in the GitHub README:

#### 🔹 Option 1: Upload directly to GitHub repo
1. Record your app screen as `.mp4`
2. Drag & drop it into a GitHub Issue or Comment (or use the “Upload files” button in the repo)
3. GitHub will generate a link like:
```

[https://github.com/sujal-1245/zilmor\_flutter\_app/assets/your-username/unique-id.mp4](https://github.com/sujal-1245/zilmor_flutter_app/assets/your-username/unique-id.mp4)

````
4. Replace that link in the `README.md` under the `📸 Preview` section.

#### 🔹 Option 2: Use YouTube
1. Upload your screen recording to YouTube
2. Copy the video ID and embed it using this markdown:

```markdown
